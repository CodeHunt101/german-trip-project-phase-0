        <p><strong>This short webpage summarises one of the most exciting and remarkable experiences of my whole life, My trip to Germany.</strong></p>
        <p>It's 2 December 2012. Finally, my dream comes true. The trip to Germany is happening!</p>
        <p>My classmates and I are thrilled of the moment. We couldn't believe that we would put our feet on foreign lands for the first time in our lives.</p>
        <p>We're at the airport, saying bye to our parents. The first flight is about to take us to the capital, Bogotá. The last time I have a flight was 10 years ago. I was so nervous and excited.</p>

        <p>We've been split up into two groups, as it was how the university decided we would fly with the aims of saving costs. The flight itinerary of my group was Barranquilla-Bogotá-Frankfurt-Berlin, whereas the other group had Barranquilla-Bogotá-Paris-Berlin.</p>

        <p><strong>The cities we visited were:</strong><p>
        <ul>
          <li>Berlin</li>
          <li>Magdeburg</li>
          <li>Dresden</li>

        <h3>BERLIN</strong></p></h3>
        <p>The first memory that comes to my mind is icy coldness. I'm in a moment of sheer euphoria as it's the first time I was facing snow in my entire life.</p>
        <p>It's the first and last city I visit. I can proudly say I touched the Berlin wall and was in front of the Checkpoint Charlie. Of course, the Brandeburg Gate wouldn't escape from the itinerary.</p>

      <div class = "container" id="magdeburg">
        <h3>MAGDEBURG</strong></p></h3>
        <p>We have the chance to talk to students and professors from the University campus we are visiting. We make some networking connections in that city.</p>

      <div class = "container" id="dresden">
        <h3>DRESDEN</strong></p></h3>
        <p>For some reason, when Dresden is in my mind, all I see is white, white, and more white!!!</p>
        <p>Heavy snows are falling on the streets, and a couple of car accidents due to slippery roads I'm able to see. The city is covered by a dense snow layer, but that's not an impediment to having ice cream at the nearest Maccas.</p>

        <h3>HAMBURG</strong></p></h3>
        <p>In love with this city!</p>
        <p>Wearing customs, my fellows and I give an entree of our cultural roots to university students at the NIT University of Hamburg.</p>
